    <string name="full_circle_lyric">If I could change the world\n
Like a fairy tale\n
I would drink the love\n
From your holy grail\n
I would start with love\n
Tell ol\' Beelzebub\n
To get outta town\n
\'Cause you just lost your job\n
How did we get so affected\n
\'Cause I think\n
Love is love reflected\n
Time\n
Don\'t let it slip away\n
Raise yo\' drinkin\' glass\n
Here\'s to yesterday\n
In time\n
We\'re all gonna trip away\n
Don\'t piss heaven off\n
We got hell to pay\n
Come full circle\n
And if\n
There\'s a spell on you that\n
I could take away\n
I would do the deed\n
Yeah, and by the way\n
Here\'s to heaven knows\n
As the circle goes\n
It ain\'t right\n
I\'m uptight\n
Yeah, get on my toes\n
I used to think that every little thing I did was crazy\n
But now I think the Karma cops are comin\' after you\n
Time\n
Don\'t let it slip away\n
Raise yo\' drinkin\' glass\n
Here\'s to yesterday\n
In time\n
We\'re all gonna trip away\n
Don\'t piss heaven off\n
We got hell to pay\n
Come full circle\n
Every time you get yourself caught up\n
Inside of someone else\'s crazy dream\n
Own it, yeah, that\'s a mistake\n
Everybody\'s gotta lot o\' nada killing\n
Them instead of killing me\n
Time\n
Don\'t let it slip away\n
Raise yo\' drinkin\' glass\n
Here\'s to yesterday\n
In time\n
We\'re all gonna trip away\n
Don\'t piss heaven off\n
We got hell to pay\n
Come full circle\n
Circle, circle</string>
    <string name="nine_lives_lyric">
        Well well well\n
I feel just like I\'m fallin\' in love\n
There\'s a new cool\n
Some kind of verbooty\n
That fits me like a velvet glove\n
And it\'s cool\n
Shu bop a doo ba\n
She\'s talkin\' to me\n
Juba to Jive\n
Yeah, the girl\'s in love\n
No doubt about it\n
The moment of truth has arrived\n
And in a wink\n
The funk was all around me\n
And I think\n
I\'m dead in love again\n
Nine Lives - Feelin\' lucky\n
Nine Lives - Live again\n
Nine Lives - It ain\'t over\n
Nine Lives - Live for ten\n
I got good luck\n
In certain situations\n
I\'m feelin\' like I hung the moon\n
And then at times\n
I\'m so weak from lovin\'\n
I couldn\'t even carry a tune\n
But now I\'m back\n
Oh yes I am\n
I maybe fall apart at the seams\n
I had a nightmare\n
Believe me when I tell you\n
Nobody ever dies in their dreams\n
I think I need a stay of execution\n
In a wink, I\'m dead in love again\n
Nine Lives - Puss &amp; booty\n
Nine Lives - Live again\n
Nine Lives - It ain\'t over\n
Nine Lives - Live for ten\n
Well well well\n
Engine room to bombardier\n
Is this a dreamI died and went to Heaven\n
She\'s enough to make you\n
Cry in your beer\n
How can a good thing\n
7 come 11\n
Slip into a fare thee well\n
And how can one man\'s\n
Little bit o\' Heaven\n
Turn into another man\'s Hell\n
I think I need a stay of execution\n
Yeah I know, I\'m dead in love again\n
Nine Lives - Hello lucky\n
Nine Lives - Live again\n
Nine Lives - It ain\'t over\n
Nine Lives - Try for ten\n
Nine Lives - Takin\' over\n
Nine Lives - Live again\n
Nine Lives - It ain\'t over\n
Nine Lives - Live for ten\n
Nine Lives - Hello lucky\n
Nine Lives - Live again\n
Nine Lives - It ain\'t over\n
Nine Lives - Live for ten\n
